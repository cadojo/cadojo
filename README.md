### Howdy! ü§†

I love exploring physical concepts through computation, including Julia and Python code. My focus for the last two years of open-source hobby projects has been astrodynamics. I want to create an ecosystem of packages that allows students to explore the solar system without having to learn complicated interfaces! I've also dabbled in other small projects: see my [r√©sum√© template](https://github.com/cadojo/resume), [`CommonLicenses.jl`](https://github.com/cadojo/CommonLicenses.jl), and my other unpinned [projects](https://github.com/cadojo?tab=repositories)!
